# R Markdown Assignment

This is an R Markdown document. This document is compiled as part of the Live Session 02 Assignment for MSDS 6306.


## 1.	Basic Math

The log of a positive number

```{r}
log(2)
```


Default base of log() function in R seems to be the natural log also written as ln() which is base e (Euler's Number) and is approximately 2.71828. Also listed are the log of the same number with a different bases.

```{r}
log(2)
log10(2)
log2(2)
```


The log of a negative number 

```{r}
log(-2)
log10(-1)
log2(-2)
```


Values are always positive. Base of a log is always positive. No exponent of a positive number can result being negative. Note: Negative exponents are possible it just means a series of divisions which again results being a very small but positive number.




## 2.	Random number generation.

First we create a vector that we call x_random, consisting of 15 standard random normal values gathered using the rnorm function. Then we and calculate its mean and standard deviation.

```{r cars}
x_random <- rnorm(15)
x_random 
mean(x_random)
sd(x_random)
```


Now we change the mean to 10 and the standard deviation to 2 and generate another set of random values using the rnorm function. And like before  calculate the mean and standard deviation of the .

```{r}
x_random <- rnorm(15, mean = 10, sd = 2)
x_random 
mean(x_random)
sd(x_random)
```


We observed that the mean of the vector slightly differs from the specified values when it was generated. rnorm is a function that generates random normals with the given standard deviation. In other words there is a deviation, a hence level of 'approximation' happens when you calculate the mean back from the sample. If you reduce the deviation you can get closer to the specified mean.

```{r}
mean(rnorm(15, mean = 10, sd = .0001))
```


#3.	Vector Operations

The weights of 6 individuals in kg are 60, 72, 57, 90, 95, 72. And their heights (in m) are 1.80, 1.85, 1.72, 1.90, 1.74, 1.91.

```{r}
x_weights <- c(60, 72, 57, 90, 95, 72)
x_heights <- c(1.80, 1.85, 1.72, 1.90, 1.74, 1.91)
x_weights 
x_heights
plot(x_weights, x_heights, main="Scatterplot", 
  	xlab="Weight ", ylab="Height", pch=19)
```

Apart from 1 outlier it seems to have a moderate positive correlation. 


The BMI for each individual is defined as BMI = weight in kg divided by the square of the height in m.

```{r}
x_BMI <- x_weights/(x_heights^2)
x_BMI
```


The mean for weight is

```{r}
x_weights_mean <- mean(x_weights)
x_weights_mean
```



Subtracting the mean from each value of weight gives

```{r}
x_weights_minus_mean <- x_weights - mean(x_weights)
x_weights_minus_mean 
```




Summing the result. Now you know why we square the deviations from the mean to calculate a standard deviation!


```{r}
sum(x_weights - mean(x_weights))
```

Or 

0.000002
